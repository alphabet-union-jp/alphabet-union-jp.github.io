# JMITU Alphabet Union
To counter the large-scale layoffs at Google, the JMITU Alphabet Union was established. Google has been coercing employees into resigning under the guise of voluntary retirement. We believe that targeting those on maternity or parental leave is a significant social issue. Please learn about what is happening at Google, spread the word, and support us to prevent this practice from spreading to other companies.

# The Problems with Google's Layoffs That You Should Know About
(auto translated by chatGPT)  
> Google has carried out large-scale layoffs affecting approximately 12,000 people worldwide. Google Japan is no exception, with about 6% of the employees, around 200 people, persumed to be targeted. Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, has sent an email to the staff stating that the company will comply with the laws in each country. However, the organizational restructuring conducted in Japan has shown many flaws. Especially egregious is that employees on maternity or parental leave are also being targeted. This has led to voices from employees saying they cannot comfortably have children under these circumstances. We have categorized the major issues into three main points......

# Union Activity about Recommendation of Resignation During Pat/Mat Leave
## May/25 Requested Administrative Guidance to Tokyo Labor Bureau
On May 25, we requested the Tokyo Labor Bureau to issue guidance on violations of the Child Care and Family Care Leave Law. Currently, the Labor Bureau is reviewing whether there were any illegal activities.  
There are two main issues: whether there was forced retirement that went beyond the scope of voluntary retirement recommendations, and whether it constitutes a violation of the Child Care and Family Care Leave Law.  
The key point in the case of forced retirement is whether the company can objectively prove that it induced the targeted individuals to believe they would be treated disadvantageously if they refused the recommendation.  
Regarding the Child Care and Family Care Leave Law, if it wasn't determined that the layoffs were due to the employees taking child care leave, the focus would be on whether it's decided, through comprehensive judgment, that the actions contradict the spirit of the law.  
Please help to spread the word about this page and discuss it with those around you. We appreciate the support of public opinion.

The form will remain open until the Labor Bureau makes its decision, so we continue to ask for your signatures.

# Letter from the impacted employee
(auto translated by chatGPT) 
<div align="center">
I received the email from the company while I was on maternity leave,<br>
just when my baby had turned two months old, and my elder child was three years old.<br>
It was during the morning feeding, a rare moment when I happened to check my seldomly viewed emails.<br>
The message was from someone I had never heard of before, stating,<br>
“We will have an interview regarding your employment with Google.”<br>
My mind went blank, unable to comprehend what was happening.<br>
At that time, I was still in the midst of nightly feedings—ten times a night—frequent diaper changes,<br> soothing cuddles, baths, all while simultaneously caring for my three-year-old daughter.<br>
My body and mind were still recovering postpartum, and I was struggling to get enough sleep.<br> 
As I held my crying baby, I couldn’t afford the time to read the email at length, only managing to glance over it between care tasks.<br>
I understood it to be a non-negotiable dismissal notice that began with “Unfortunately.”<br>
I felt abruptly discarded by the company, overwhelmed with anxiety and stress during feedings,<br>
fearing it might affect my milk supply and my infant's ability to focus and grow.<br>
Crushed by a multitude of fears and uncertainties, the day came to sign the papers, and I felt coerced into signing.<br>
During such a critical and precious time in the life of a parent and a zero-year-old child,<br>
I never imagined Google would take such a harsh approach......[Read Full Letter](letter_layoff_en.md)<br>

# Labor Consultation
The labor union deals with all kinds of work-related issues, from major societal issues such as encouraging resignation and harassment, to small inconveniences at work such as office supplies or remote work.  
Collective bargaining and the right to request guidance from the labor commission are rights legally granted only to labor unions.  
While the company is not obligated to respond to the opinions of a single employee, it is legally obliged to provide sincere and satisfactory explanations to the opinions and questions of the labor union.  
For the question "Can I refuse this encouragement to resign?" that the target of the resignation encouragement asked multiple times without getting an answer, the company clearly responded in the collective negotiation that "this encouragement to resign is voluntary".  
Please refer to [this doc](resign_questions.md) for more detail about recommendation of resignation.  
Google is a company that has a culture of openly soliciting opinions from employees, but even so, there are cases where you can't get an answer if you ask as a single employee, but you can get a response if you ask through a labor union.   
The labor union will always keep secrets. Please use it as one option of the consultation services.  

An example of a labor consultation:  
> A consulting party, who has a child with a disability certificate, came to seek advice because they were denied the use of Family Emergency Leave for their child's regular medical appointments. They were told that "Family Emergency Leave is intended for unexpected situations and cannot be used for regular medical appointments." We advised them that in Japan, employees are guaranteed Caregiver Leave and Nursing Leave, and that Google Japan positions Family Emergency Leave as part of the usage for these two leaves. We also pointed out that the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's website states that these leaves can be used for accompanying regular medical appointments. As a result, the consulting party was able to obtain Family Emergency Leave, and the "urgent" designation was removed from the explanation of Family Emergency Leave on myGoogle.
