The JMITU Alphabet Union (JAU) promotes fair and legal labor practices, working towards building a brighter work future. We advocate to protect [Google’s Values and Culture](https://about.google/community-guidelines/), enabling Googlers to focus on our mission. All workers have the right to work in a safe environment, and to choose their own careers. When something impedes that choice, we stand together to assist in removing those obstacles.

# Latest updates about the labor committee session
The JMITU AU Branch filed a request for relief in November 2023 regarding the refusal to bargain collectively in May 2023, and is currently in dispute at the Tokyo Labor Committee. As of January 23, 2025, the case has reached a critical juncture, and we plan to conduct a hearing plan at the next hearing date and witness examination at the following one. We appreciate your support through attending the hearings.  
The next hearing date is February 3, 2025, at 3:00 PM.  
[Detail](labor_committee.md)  

# Branch History
JAU was formed in response to the workforce reductions that occurred in March 2023 in Japan. The branch was started when employees who were on maternity or childcare leave spoke out about their role eliminations and being encouraged to retire. Since then, the number of impacted Googlers in Japan has increased due to additional rounds of team restructurings. JAU’s priority has been focused on opposing illegal forced resignations, discrimination (including compensation reductions) and/or harassment of Googlers.

### Messages From Union Members
> The action of joining union itself is very empowering to me. Members are coming together and sharing our power and love, this is creating a stronger mental strength. ---Kangaroo

> With time I began to understand the crucial role our labor union plays. They champion fair treatment, ensure our safety, and advocate tirelessly for our individual rights, which truly moved me to support their cause. ---Sasano K

> When feeling cornered and unsure of what to do, receiving support from a union can be incredibly reassuring and invaluable, beyond what words can express. When subjected to unfair and unjust treatment, you should not just endure it; instead, raise your voice and protest. Correcting these wrongful acts and environments will make our workplaces and society better. ---Seninbari

# Labor Consultation
The labor union deals with all kinds of work-related issues, from major societal issues such as encouraging resignation and harassment, to small inconveniences at work such as office supplies or remote work.  
The labor union will always keep secrets. Please use it as one option of the consultation services.  

An example of a labor consultation:  
> A consulting party, who has a child with a disability certificate, came to seek advice because they were denied the use of Family Emergency Leave for their child's regular medical appointments. They were told that "Family Emergency Leave is intended for unexpected situations and cannot be used for regular medical appointments." We advised them that in Japan, employees are guaranteed Caregiver Leave and Nursing Leave, and that Google Japan positions Family Emergency Leave as part of the usage for these two leaves. We also pointed out that the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's website states that these leaves can be used for accompanying regular medical appointments. As a result, the consulting party was able to obtain Family Emergency Leave, and the "urgent" designation was removed from the explanation of Family Emergency Leave on myGoogle.
