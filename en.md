# The Problems with Google's Layoffs That You Should Know About
(auto translated by chatGPT)  
> Google has carried out large-scale layoffs affecting approximately 12,000 people worldwide. Google Japan is no exception, with about 6% of the employees, around 200 people, persumed to be targeted. Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, has sent an email to the staff stating that the company will comply with the laws in each country. However, the organizational restructuring conducted in Japan has shown many flaws. Especially egregious is that employees on maternity or parental leave are also being targeted. This has led to voices from employees saying they cannot comfortably have children under these circumstances. We have categorized the major issues into three main points......

# Union Activity about Lack of Explanation on the Layoff
Collective bargaining is a fundamental part of communication between workers and the company, and it is legally protected as a right of the labor union. It is considered an act of unfair labor practice if a company refuses to respond to a collective bargaining request without a valid reason or does not provide a sincere explanation during the collective bargaining process. The company has a duty to respond to the demands of the labor union or explain why it cannot comply if unable to do so.  

The Alphabet Union has submitted three collective bargaining proposals to the company regarding this round of layoffs. However, the company prematurely ended the bargaining process after only two sessions, and without providing sufficient explanation, refused the third request.  

Regarding this matter, we filed a relief request with the Tokyo Labor Bureau on 11/14.  

Illegal actions against workers can also result in significant damage to the company. Collective bargaining is crucial to prevent unethical and illegal actions, like the [retirement encouragement directed at employees on parental leave that occurred on 3/2](https://alphabet-union-jp.github.io/en.html#union-activity-about-recommendation-of-resignation-during-patmat-leave). I believe that Google's refusal to engage in collective bargaining and the occurrence of such illegal actions are two sides of the same coin.  

A labor tribunal relief request is like a lawsuit for labor unions, and it also incurs attorney fees. Your contributions, in the form of donations, can greatly assist us. We are also running a crowdfunding campaign, so you can support us through that as well.

## Collective Bargaining History
We initially proposed the first round of collective bargaining on March 2nd, but the company designated March 22nd, after the voluntary retirement recommendation deadline of March 17th. In this meeting, they explained that the retirement recommendation was voluntary, that there would be no further rounds of retirement recommendations for the current targets, that the number of layoffs was decided by the project area leaders on a team basis, and that the targets comprised 6% of the total Alphabet workforce. However, no further explanation was provided about the company's financial situation, they merely referred us to Investor Relations. The financial figures from Investor Relations showed a profit, which isn't a satisfactory explanation. The company could not provide definitive answers about what would happen to employees who rejected the retirement recommendation, or the possibility of a second wave.

We proposed the second round of collective bargaining on April 4th, but the company designated a date more than a month later, May 9th. Despite asking again about the company's financial situation, they said that the information was confidential and even the attendees were not informed. It is illegal and constitutes unfair labor practices for a person with the authority to respond to the labor union's demands not to attend collective bargaining. There was also no explanation given about the target number for reductions, the number of targets in Google Japan, the number of targets on long-term leave, or the number of people who accepted the retirement recommendation.

May 31st is the retirement deadline for those who have accepted the retirement recommendation. We requested a third round of collective bargaining on May 9th in order to give those who may have accepted the retirement recommendation under the misunderstanding that they would be dismissed otherwise, a chance to make another decision with proper information. However, the company unilaterally ended the collective bargaining, stating there was no room for further dialogue.

We believe the root of the problem with these layoffs lies in the lack of two explanations: the necessity of the layoffs to the employees, and the future prospects for the targets. A healthy labor-management relationship is built through explanation and communication. Without explaining these key points in collective bargaining, it's impossible to solve problems through dialogue. To make collective bargaining healthy, the law obliges companies to respond sincerely. We have requested relief from the Labor Commission to ensure that collective bargaining delivers the necessary information to employees.

The relief request to the Labor Commission is similar to a labor union lawsuit conducted by the labor union as an organization. It also involves legal fees. Your support, in the form of donations, can be a significant help.

# Union Activity about Recommendation of Resignation During Pat/Mat Leave
## 11/14 Notification from the Labor Bureau of Illegal Conduct

We have received notification from the Labor Bureau regarding the layoff conducted on 3/2. Following our request for guidance submitted to the Labor Bureau on 5/25, they acknowledged illegal actions and provided guidance. The union's claim involved illegal pressure to resign, exceeding the legal framework for suggesting retirement, especially towards employees on maternity or paternity leave. The Labor Bureau did not disclose specific details of the recognized illegal actions. They reported that they would administer administrative guidance and, if no improvement is seen within a certain period, would issue a correction recommendation. Currently, under the mediation of the Labor Bureau, negotiations for a settlement are underway.  
  
We understand this as a testament to the Labor Bureau acknowledging the public interest and support shown through signatures and other means. Here is the message from the impacted employee.  
  
---
Faced with a shocking situation while caring for a 2-month-old baby, I decided to make this fact public, driven by the desire for a more work-friendly society.  
  
With 16,586 astonishing signatures received, we have reached this point thanks to the support of many people.  
  
We are sincerely grateful to everyone.  

---
The Labor Bureau investigates only cases that have been submitted. Without an application, similar cases will not automatically receive remedial measures. If you are facing difficulties due to being encouraged to retire, please consult with a labor union or the Labor Bureau.  

Furthermore, we believe that cases like this are undesirable for both employees and companies. Preventing such cases is one of the roles of collective bargaining. However, the company has neglected and refused this collective bargaining. To prevent such unfortunate situations, please be informed about [the application for relief to the Labor Commission](https://alphabet-union-jp.github.io/en.html#union-activity-about-lack-of-explanation-on-the-layoff) regarding refusal of collective bargaining. 
 

## May/25 Requested Administrative Guidance to Tokyo Labor Bureau
On May 25, we requested the Tokyo Labor Bureau to issue guidance on violations of the Child Care and Family Care Leave Law. Currently, the Labor Bureau is reviewing whether there were any illegal activities.  
There are two main issues: whether there was forced retirement that went beyond the scope of voluntary retirement recommendations, and whether it constitutes a violation of the Child Care and Family Care Leave Law.  
The key point in the case of forced retirement is whether the company can objectively prove that it induced the targeted individuals to believe they would be treated disadvantageously if they refused the recommendation.  
Regarding the Child Care and Family Care Leave Law, if it wasn't determined that the layoffs were due to the employees taking child care leave, the focus would be on whether it's decided, through comprehensive judgment, that the actions contradict the spirit of the law.  
Please help to spread the word about this page and discuss it with those around you. We appreciate the support of public opinion.

## Jun/23 Submitted Signatures to Tokyo Labor Bureau

The form will remain open until the Labor Bureau makes its decision, so we continue to ask for your signatures.

# Letter from the impacted employee
(auto translated by chatGPT) 
<div align="center">
I received the email from the company while I was on maternity leave,<br>
just when my baby had turned two months old, and my elder child was three years old.<br>
It was during the morning feeding, a rare moment when I happened to check my seldomly viewed emails.<br>
The message was from someone I had never heard of before, stating,<br>
“We will have an interview regarding your employment with Google.”<br>
My mind went blank, unable to comprehend what was happening.<br>
At that time, I was still in the midst of nightly feedings—ten times a night—frequent diaper changes,<br> soothing cuddles, baths, all while simultaneously caring for my three-year-old daughter.<br>
My body and mind were still recovering postpartum, and I was struggling to get enough sleep.<br> 
As I held my crying baby, I couldn’t afford the time to read the email at length, only managing to glance over it between care tasks.<br>
I understood it to be a non-negotiable dismissal notice that began with “Unfortunately.”<br>
I felt abruptly discarded by the company, overwhelmed with anxiety and stress during feedings,<br>
fearing it might affect my milk supply and my infant's ability to focus and grow.<br>
Crushed by a multitude of fears and uncertainties, the day came to sign the papers, and I felt coerced into signing.<br>
During such a critical and precious time in the life of a parent and a zero-year-old child,<br>
I never imagined Google would take such a harsh approach......<a href="https://alphabet-union-jp.github.io/letter_layoff_en.html#letter-from-the-impacted-employee">Read Full Letter</a><br>

# Labor Consultation
The labor union deals with all kinds of work-related issues, from major societal issues such as encouraging resignation and harassment, to small inconveniences at work such as office supplies or remote work.  
The labor union will always keep secrets. Please use it as one option of the consultation services.  

An example of a labor consultation:  
> A consulting party, who has a child with a disability certificate, came to seek advice because they were denied the use of Family Emergency Leave for their child's regular medical appointments. They were told that "Family Emergency Leave is intended for unexpected situations and cannot be used for regular medical appointments." We advised them that in Japan, employees are guaranteed Caregiver Leave and Nursing Leave, and that Google Japan positions Family Emergency Leave as part of the usage for these two leaves. We also pointed out that the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's website states that these leaves can be used for accompanying regular medical appointments. As a result, the consulting party was able to obtain Family Emergency Leave, and the "urgent" designation was removed from the explanation of Family Emergency Leave on myGoogle.
