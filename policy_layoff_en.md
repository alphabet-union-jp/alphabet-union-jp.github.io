# The Problems with Google's Layoffs That You Should Know About
(auto translated by chatGPT)  
Google has carried out large-scale layoffs affecting approximately 12,000 people worldwide. Google Japan is no exception, with about 6% of the employees, around 200 people, persumed to be targeted. Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, has sent an email to the staff stating that the company will comply with the laws in each country. However, the organizational restructuring conducted in Japan has shown many flaws. Especially egregious is that employees on maternity or parental leave are also being targeted. This has led to voices from employees saying they cannot comfortably have children under these circumstances. We have categorized the major issues into three main points.

## The Fear of Lack of Explanation and Pressure to Resign
The first issue is the lack of adequate explanation to those targeted for layoffs. The company has stated that it has provided understanding and detailed explanations to the targeted employees during collective negotiations with the union. However, the reality is quite different. The notification from the company was essentially, "Your role (position within the team) has been impacted by the restructuring," a message that implied to employees hired under job-based employment, a break in the careers they had built in their current roles and potentially, a forced layoff. Those targeted were told, "If you sign within two weeks, we'll pay you a severance package," and no matter how much they asked for an explanation, nothing was mentioned about what would happen if they adamantly recommend to sign. Some union members were only told that if they refused, they would be repeatedly urged to sign. As the deadline approached, an additional email sent from the company to the targeted employees stated that if they refused, their access to the internal system might be limited. This wording reminds us of the "lockout" layoffs carried out at the headquarters before Japan, suggesting the removal of employee access as a form of termination. With insufficient explanation from the company, those targeted were forced to make decisions within a short period of two weeks. Those who believed that they would be laid off if they refused, and therefore would not receive the early retirement package, signed and later consulted the union. Can we say this is a voluntary recommendation to retire when people who cannot afford to quit their jobs due to having pre-school children end up signing due to fear?  

Indeed, some of the scenarios that the targeted employees envisioned have become reality. Cases have been seen where employees who did not agree to the suggested retirement are ordered to transfer to a temporary team composed only of those who did not agree, with no future business plan. Although it is said that their current salary will not decrease, they are suddenly reassigned to entirely different duties. If they cannot produce results equivalent to their previous positions in these unfamiliar tasks, their salary will decrease from the next year. This approach, which cuts off the careers individuals have built, is unacceptable from the standpoint of the labor union.

## Unilateral Resignation Conditions
The second issue is that the conditions were far too one-sided. In a typical "recommended retirement," shouldn't the company thoroughly adjust the timing and amount with the targeted individuals for retirement? The company's approach this time was to unilaterally impose conditions, and there was absolutely no attitude to make adjustments according to individual circumstances. The retirement date was uniformly set as May 31, even for those who planned to take long-term leave after that due to maternity leave, parental leave, or sick leave. In collective bargaining, we asked the company to consider allowing those on maternity and parental leave to remain until the end of their leave. Reasons include the impossibility of using childcare facilities if they quit, the impracticality of job-hunting while caring for children, and the difficulty of finding new employment after losing their company affiliation. It was an urgent wish tied to their children's lives. However, the company consistently did not change the format of "termination as of May 31." Salary during maternity and parental leave is paid by the local government, not by the company. Despite no financial damage to the company, they made no concessions. We believe this is due to pressure from the parent company. Although the company insists it is a nominal recommendation for retirement, isn't their policy proof of essentially unilateral layoffs?  

In Japanese society, households raising children are especially vulnerable, as they have no choice but to depend on the company for their livelihood. Therefore, Japan has the Child Care Leave Law to protect households raising children. The sudden retirement notice given during child-rearing contradicts the original spirit of the Child Care Leave Law, disrupts careers and family time, and unilaterally harms the environment where the person involved can healthily raise their children. However, the company insists that it's "not illegal" and offers no apology.

## Lack of Effort to Avoid Layoffs
The third issue is the lack of "effort to avoid" layoffs, which is required when carrying out mass layoffs. The company explained in collective bargaining that there had been some reduction in executive compensation, but subsequent various reports show that Sundar Pichai, the CEO who issued this major restructuring, received compensation exceeding the previous year. The union has not received any information that the remuneration of the representative of the Japanese corporation has been reduced. The business figures for Google, listed in the Investor Relations issued by the parent company Alphabet, have continued to be profitable over the past few years, which doesn't necessitate layoffs. Expense reductions, such as downsizing employee benefits including the staff cafeteria and gym, were carried out on a small scale as a pretext after the layoffs. The union speculates that the layoffs were carried out based on the intentions of shareholders rather than performance, etc. Indeed, the stock price rose immediately after the layoffs. Despite claiming to respect Japanese law and recommending retirement, the company's real intention in this reorganization might have been unilateral layoffs aimed at demonstrating the company's stance to shareholders, going beyond merely reducing personnel expenses.
